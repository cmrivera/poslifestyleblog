      <h2>Deadlift Daily to Get Stronger</h2>
    <p>A deadlift is a skill-based movement that takes considerable practice to hone and refine. It should be performed daily in order to keep that pattern sharp and to show significant improvement.
         You can perform the Deadlift in various ways including high max reps, and low intensity reps as well.  A Deadlift should be practiced everyday to perfect the form.
         Here's an example of how you could work on deadlifting every day, or involve some sort of deadlifting movement and form on a regular basis:</p>
         <hr>

         <ol>
         <li>Monday: Max-tension development, using only 75% of your max weight. Do 10 sets of 5 reps. Rest as needed in between the sets.  </li>
        <li>Tuesday: Max speed. Use 60% of your max weight and work on pulling the weight from the floor to lockout as fast as possible. Do 8 sets of 3 reps. Rest in between sets.  </li>
        <li>Wednesday: Near-max lifts. Use 90% of your max weight.  Complete a couple of light weight warm up sets.  Then perform 10 single rep sets at 90% of max weight. Rest as needed between sets.</li>
         <li>Thursday: 20 x 20 kettlebell swings performed for a minute to complete a set. Work on getting the hips to snap the movement fast and hard while keeping the core tense and strong.  Rest between each set. Try 5 sets, if not as many sets as you can comfortably do.  </li>
        <li>Friday: Pause x 2 deadlifts.  Use 75% of your max weight.  On the way up, pause for 3 seconds at 3 inches below the knee, then again at 3 inches above the knee, and then finish at lockout. Lower the weight in one move.   Complete 6 sets of 5 reps.  Rest between sets. </li>
        <li>Saturday: Using 85% of your max, do 1 rep every 30 seconds for 10 minutes.</li>
         <li>Sunday: Rest day. </li>
        </ol>
