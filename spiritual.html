<p>	A Quick Reference Guide on How to Meditate for Beginners

	Meditation is a rising practice attracting minds from all over the world.  The appeal is quite understandable, who would not love to be relaxed, have less stress and improve their mind at the same time.  The unfortunate thing is many of us are to busy to read extensive books on the topic to learn.  Hopefully, this quick reference guide on how to meditate for beginners will lighten that load for you.  
	Now the first thing is to discuss with yourself your goals with meditation.  You can jot this down, type it on your device, just keep it to reference back to when you become frustrated.  Now write those goals; maybe they are to sleep better, relax more, calm yourself in tough situations etcetera, write it down. 

		There are so many options, where should one start?

	There are countless methods of meditation you can begin with.  A simple one to try is mantra meditation (a mantra is a word or phrase that helps bring positivity and peace). Find a comfortable position sitting tall, or laying down.  While you are there begin gradually controlling your breath and closing your eyes.  Breathe in, hold a moment between, then on the exhale recite “om”.  Hold it for the exhale.  Then repeat, repeating the mantra on each exhale. Repeat for a minute to start off then gradually work your way up every day.   That simple task will show you improvements as much as long sessions. 
It’s that simple for mantra meditation.  As you improve try other mantras such as “Be the change you wish to see in the world” (Gandhi).  Feel free to use mantras in which ever language you feel most comfortable using.  After you have experimented with mantra meditation, then try working with breathing meditation techniques to dive even further.
Breathing meditations can be hard to work through.  However, keep practicing and you will improve.  A good beginner method to try is as follows:
-Comfortably sit tall or lay down.  
-Begin to breathe in and out and slowly start to close your eyes and control your breathing.
-If your mind wonders this is ok, it happens to us all.  When this happens bring attention back to your breathing by reciting a long “In” as you inhale and a long “Out” on the exhale.  
-Make sure to hold a moment in between inhales and exhales.  
-Try this for a minute to start then each day gradually increase when you feel ready.
